! AUDIT: HIGH - Track/course geometry pipeline well-supported by verified
!   function addresses, VDP2 register patterns, and 3-course architecture.
!   Two terrain collision addresses (0x0603449C, 0x0603458C) are NOT labeled
!   functions in the binary - they are mid-function branch targets. Course
!   physics size claims (exactly 282 bytes each) are incorrect (actual:
!   332, 312, 318 bytes). Specific role labels (vertex builder, culling,
!   etc.) are reasonable inferences but not definitively confirmed.

! Track Geometry & Course Data System
! =============================================================================
!
! This file documents the track/course geometry pipeline â€” functions that
! construct track segments, manage road surfaces, handle terrain collision
! meshes, and load course-specific data from ROM.
!
! Address range: 0x06015000-0x0601A000 (primary)
!                0x0603449C-0x06034B9A (terrain collision mesh)
!

! TRACK SEGMENT CONSTRUCTION (0x06016CDC-0x06017CEC)
! =============================================================================
!
! Track geometry is organized as a linked list of segments, each with a
! 0x44-byte (68-byte) stride containing position, rotation, and visual data.
!
! Core segment structure:
!   +0x00: Type/ID byte
!   +0x10: X position (32-bit fixed-point)
!   +0x14: Y position
!   +0x18: Z position
!   +0x1C: Rotation X
!   +0x20: Rotation Y
!   +0x24: Rotation Z
!   +0x30-0x38: Position variants (LOD/collision)
