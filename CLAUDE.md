# Active Workstreams

> **READ THIS FIRST after compaction.**
> All problems we face are solvable with enough time and effort. Nothing is intractable, but they may be challenging!

| # | Workstream | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Free Build Emulator Compat** | **ACTIVE** | workstreams/active_investigation.md — ICF_FIX+CD_FIX retired, SCDQ_FIX remains |
| 2 | Disc File RE | Complete | workstreams/disc_file_re.md — DISPROVEN: no offset-based APROG.BIN refs in disc files |
| 3 | Road To Boot | Paused | workstreams/PAUSED_road_to_boot.md |
| 4 | Daytona USA Re-implementation | Paused | workstreams/reimplementation.md |

**Free build**: `make free-disc SCDQ_FIX=1` — boots to title screen, mode select works, can race laps.
**ICF_FIX retired (2026-02-20)**: Root cause was a missed cache-through relocation in FUN_06034F08. Fixed in ASM.
**CD_FIX retired (2026-02-21)**: Was redundant with SCDQ_FIX (same CD PAUSE timing issue). Patch deleted.
**Remaining bypass**: SCDQ_FIX only (CD PAUSE handler latent bug exposed by +4 timing shift).
See `workstreams/active_investigation.md`.

## Investigation Discipline

**No bypass commits without root cause.** A bypass (timeout, NOP, skip) is a diagnostic tool,
not a fix. You can USE a bypass to unblock testing, but never COMMIT one as the solution.
If you find yourself writing a workaround, you've found the symptom — now find the cause.

# Project Overview

Reverse engineer Sega Saturn Daytona USA (1995) — extract gameplay code (physics, steering, collision, AI) for transplanting into Daytona USA CCE (1996).


## WSL Gotchas

- **CRLF**: Files written on Windows have CRLF. Pipe through `tr -d '\r'` when reading in WSL. Makefiles with `ifeq` are especially sensitive.
- **grep tabs**: `grep '^\t...'` does NOT match tabs in basic regex. Use `grep -P '^\t...'` (Perl regex).
- **Running scripts**: `wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash script.sh` works, but scripts need CRLF handling (see setup.sh for pattern).
