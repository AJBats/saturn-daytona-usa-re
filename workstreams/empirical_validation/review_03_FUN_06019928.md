# Review #3: track_seg_phys_init → FUN_06019928

**Verdict**: RENAMED — reverted to address-based name
**Date**: 2026-03-01

## Original Claim

Name `track_seg_phys_init` implied one-time track segment physics initialization.
VERIFIED tag said: "initializes track segment data used by physics system."

## Evidence Against

1. **Called every frame during menu idle.** Call graphs show it present in menu state
   with no track or physics activity. A one-time init wouldn't run every frame.

2. **Behavior is a flag poll.** Reads a flag byte (sym_06085FF1), does work when set,
   clears it. This is a deferred-work-on-flag pattern, not initialization.

3. **Present across multiple game states.** Appears in car select and circuit select
   call graphs too — not specific to any track loading moment.

4. **No track data references confirmed.** The "track segment" part of the name was
   inferred from pool entries, which are LLM-generated annotations (not evidence).

## What We Know

- Address: 0x06019928 (retail)
- Called from: state_car_select_active (via BSR)
- Pattern: reads flag byte, does conditional work, clears flag
- Active in: menu, car select, circuit select states
- NOT a one-time init — runs every frame

## Lesson

Function frequency (every frame vs one-time) is a strong signal. If a function runs
during menu idle with no relevant game activity, its name shouldn't reference that
activity. Poll-and-dispatch patterns look different from init patterns.
